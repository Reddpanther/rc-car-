Step 7

Afterward, attach the servo motor and ultrasonic sensor as follows.
Step 8

Next, connect the servo motor and the ultrasonic sensor using the circuit diagram above.
Step 9

Then, connect the Bluetooth module to the motor driver shield and glue it to the robot chassis.
Step 10

After, glue the battery holder and connect it to the driver shield.
Step 11

Now, attach the robot wheels and put the batteries to the battery holder.
