Firstly, identify these components.

L293D motor driver shield

Ultrasonic sensor

Bluetooth module

Servo motor

Li-ion battery

Li-ion battery

Foamboard

Robot wheel

Gear motor

Jumper wires

Arduino UNO board                     
         
Step 2

Secondly, cut the foam boardinto 11x12 cm 

Step 3

Thirdly, glue the four gear motors to the foam board piece.

Step 4

Then, attach the motor shield to the Arduino board and glue it to the robot chassis.
Step 5

Next, dig two holes on either side of the Arduino board and insert the gear motor wire through these holes.on the 12 cm side 
Step 6

Then, connect the motors to the motor driver shield. To do this, just lan the driven on arduino by seeing the holes on uno and the pins on the driver just insert the driver pins on the uno holes 

Step 7

Afterward, stick the servo motor on the board and ultrasonic sensor on the servo using glue or doublr tape 
Step 8

Next, connect the servo motor and the ultrasonic sensor 
Step 9

Then, connect the Bluetooth module to the motor driver shield and glue it to the robot chassis.
Step 10

After, glue the battery holder ont he board and connect it to the driver shield.
Step 11

Now, attach the robot wheels and put the batteries to the battery holder.
step 12 

now moving to the coding part, install arduino ide on your pc/laptop and copy/paste the arduino code file that i`ve given
